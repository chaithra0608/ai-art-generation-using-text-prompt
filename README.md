# ai-art-generation-using-text-prompt
 The core idea of the project is to convert natural language input into corresponding  digital art using pre-trained diffusion models. Instead of training a model from scratch, this project utilizes the Stable Diffusion v1.5 pipeline in Google Colab, which allows us to run advanced  AI models on free GPU resources
